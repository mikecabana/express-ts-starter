# express-ts-starter

A starter express app using Typescript! The point of this project is to give you a super simple foundation to get off the ground quickly. It's unopiniated, has no structure(ish) and no templating. These are decisions you'll need to makeðŸ˜œ!

Oh it also gives you VSCode debuging to boot!
